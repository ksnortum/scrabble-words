<h1>Readme for scrabble.pl</h1>

<p><code>scrabble.pl</code> is a command line Scrabble(r) word generator written in Perl.  See 
<code>scrabble.html</code> for syntax and command line options.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Install Perl if Needed</h2>

<p>You need Perl to run <code>scrabble.pl</code>.  First see if your distribution has it installed.  Go
to a command line and type</p>

<pre><code>perl -v
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't get a copyright notice for Perl, install it.  Go to 
<a href="http://www.perl.org">the Perl webpage</a>.  For Windows(r) I suggest 
<a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a>.</p>

<h2>Install the Custom Modules</h2>

<p>The custom modules <code>Permutation.pm</code> and <code>Subset.pm</code> should be installed in a 
system-accessible area, but you don't have to do this if you're going to run 
everything from
one directory.  If you type <code>perl -V</code> (that's a capital V) at the end you will see
the contents of @INC.  This is Perl's install "path" to modules.  There is usually a
dot (current
directory) at the end.  If so, you can put the modules in the same directory as the
<code>scrabble.pl</code> file.  You should also see a path that ends with "site" or "site_perl".
This is where you can put <code>Permutation.pm</code> and <code>Subset.pm</code> if you want to use them
in other Perl programs.  You can use <code>permutations.pl</code> and <code>subset.pl</code> to test that the 
modules are installed and working properly.</p>

<h2>Install the Word Libraries</h2>

<p>Unzip the two Scrabble word dictionaries using <code>gunzip</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gunzip sowpods.txt.gz
gunzip twl.txt.gz
</code></pre>

<p>You can put these libraries anywhere.  On Unix-like systems you can try 
/usr/local/lib/scrabble/.  Modify <code>scrabble.pl</code> to point to the correct path:</p>

<pre><code>my $SOWPODS_PATH = "/usr/local/lib/scrabble/sowpods.txt";
</code></pre>

<p>SOWPODS and Collins are the same dictionary.  If you want to your system's spell check
dictionary or any other custom dictionary, set its path for the WORDS_PATH and use
WORDS as your custom dictionary on the command line.</p>

<pre><code>my $WORDS_PATH = "/usr/share/dict/words";
</code></pre>

<h1>Running scrabble.pl</h1>

<p>The easiest way to run <code>scrabble.pl</code> is to <code>cd</code> into the directory where you copied
the script and type</p>

<pre><code>perl ./scrabble.pl
</code></pre>

<p>Whether you need to type <code>perl</code> depends on your system.</p>

<h2>Unix-like Systems</h2>

<p>Perl is usually already installed and in your PATH.  At the very top of <code>scrabble.pl</code>
you should see <code>#! /usr/bin/perl</code>.  This tells the shell what this script should be
run with.  Type <code>which perl</code> and make sure /usr/bin/perl is valid for your system and
change it if necessary.  If you make <code>scrabble.pl</code> executable (see man chmod) you do
not need to type <code>perl</code>.  If you copy <code>scrabble.pl</code> into a directory in your PATH, you
do no need to cd into the directory.  At that point you should be able to do the following
from any directory:</p>

<pre><code>scrabble.pl [options] &lt;letters&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>You will probably need to install Perl (see first paragraph).  If the installer hasn't
done it for you already, put the path to <code>perl.exe</code> in your PATH.  Now you can <code>cd</code>
into the folder where you copied <code>scrabble.pl</code> and type</p>

<pre><code>perl .\scrabble.pl
</code></pre>

<p>Getting <code>scrabble.pl</code> to execute Perl automatically may have been by your installer
(try just <code>scrabble.pl</code> to check).  If not, you will want to associate the .pl
extension with Perl.  Probably the easiest way to do this is to display <code>scrabble.pl</code>
in the Windows Explorer (Files, not Internet).  Right-click on the file and click on
Choose Default Program.  Select <code>perl.exe</code> or Perl Interpreter.</p>

<h1>Limitations</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can only use one blank tile (dot) at a time, and even one increases the process
time greatly.</li>
</ul>
