<h1>Readme for scrabble.pl</h1>

<p><code>scrabble.pl</code> is a command line Scrabble(r) word generator written in Perl.  See 
<code>scrabble.html</code> for syntax and command line options.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Install Perl if Needed</h2>

<p>You need Perl to run <code>scrabble.pl</code>.  First see if your distribution has it installed.  Go
to a command line and type</p>

<pre><code>perl -v
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't get a copyright notice for Perl, install it.  Go to 
<a href="http://www.perl.org">the Perl webpage</a>.  For Windows(r) I suggest 
<a href="http://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a>.</p>

<h2>Install the Custom Modules</h2>

<p>The custom modules <code>Permutation.pm</code> and <code>Subset.pm</code> need to be installed.  Look in 
Perl installation directory and you should see a site/lib directory.  Copy the two
files there.  You can use <code>permutations.pl</code> and <code>subset.pl</code> to test that the 
modules are installed and working properly.</p>

<h2>Install the Word Libraries</h2>

<p>Unzip the two Scrabble word dictionaries using <code>gunzip</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gunzip sowpods.txt.gz
gunzip twl.txt.gz
</code></pre>

<p>You can put these libraries anywhere.  On Unix-like systems you can try 
/usr/local/lib/scrabble/.  Modify <code>scrabble.pl</code> to point to the correct path:</p>

<pre><code>my $SOWPODS_PATH = "/usr/local/lib/scrabble/sowpods.txt";
</code></pre>

<p>SOWPODS and Collins are the same dictionary.  If you want to your system's spell check
dictionary or any other custom dictionary, set its path for the WORDS_PATH and use
WORDS as your custom dictionary on the command line.</p>

<pre><code>my $WORDS_PATH = "/usr/share/dict/words";
</code></pre>

<h1>Limitations</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>You can only use one blank tile (dot) at a time, and even one increases the process
time greatly.</p></li>
<li><p>If the program uses a blank tile as, say, a "z", it counts this in the score.  All
blank tiles should have a value of zero.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot give the positions of any letters, but you can accomplish this with the 
list output and piping to <code>grep</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
